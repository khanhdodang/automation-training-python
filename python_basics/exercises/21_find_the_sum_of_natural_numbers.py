'''
In the program below, we've used an if...else statement in combination with a while loop to calculate the sum of natural numbers up to num.
'''

# Sum of natural numbers up to num

num = 16

if num < 0:
   print("Enter a positive number")
else:
   sum = 0
   # use while loop to iterate until zero
   while(num > 0):
       sum += num
       num -= 1
   print("The sum is", sum)
